# BillSplit - Backend

BillSplit is an app for splitting expenses with your friends. It lets you and your friends add various bills and keep track of who owes who, and then it helps you to settle up with each other. Here's a quick overview of how it works.First, sign up for an account!. Next, create a group. Once you've created your group, you and your friends can all start adding expenses! Go to your group, then hit the 'Add bill' button. You'll be asked for various details about your expense, like the total cost, who paid, and how much each person should owe. As soon as you hit 'Save', BillSplit will update everyone's balances to keep track of how much each person owes. Later, after you've added a bunch of expenses, you'll probably want to settle up with your friends. Just hit the 'Settle up' button to pay back your friend. You can record a cash payment (e.g. you just handed your friend some cash.
